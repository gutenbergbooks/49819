the possibilities of science as has the development of atomic
power. In the last 200 years, people have seen the coming of
the steam engine, the steamboat, the railroad locomotive,
the automobile, the airplane, radio, motion pictures, television,
the machine age in general. Yet none of it seemed quite
so fantastic, quite so unbelievable, as what man has done
since 1939 with the atom ... there seem to be almost no
limits to what may lie ahead: inexhaustible energy, new
worlds, ever-widening knowledge of the physical universe.</i>

<p>In a way, nuclear energy has been serving man as long as
he has existed. It has served all of life; it has flooded the
earth for billions of years. The sun, you see, is a vast nuclear
engine, and the warmth and light that the sun radiates is the
product of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>In order for man to learn to produce and control nuclear
energy himself, however (something that did not take place
until this century), three lines of investigation&mdash;atoms,
electricity, and energy&mdash;had to develop and meet.</p>
<p>We will begin with atoms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h2 id="c2">ATOMIC WEIGHTS</h2>
<p>As long ago as ancient Greek times, there were men who
suspected that all matter consisted of tiny particles which
were far too small to see. Under ordinary circumstances, they
could not be divided into anything smaller, and they were
called &ldquo;atoms&rdquo; from a Greek word meaning &ldquo;indivisible&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was not until 1808, however, that this &ldquo;atomic theory&rdquo;
was really put on a firm foundation. In that year the English
chemist John Dalton (1766-1844) published a book in which
he discussed atoms in detail. Every element, he suggested,
was made up of its own type of atoms. The atoms of one
element were different from the atoms of every other
element. The chief difference between the various atoms lay
in their mass, or weight.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Dalton was the first to try to determine what these
masses might be. He could not work out the actual masses in
ounces or grams, for atoms were far too tiny to weigh with
any of his instruments. He could, however, determine their
relative weights; that is, how much more massive one kind of
atom might be than another.</p>
<p>For instance, he found that a quantity of hydrogen gas
invariably combined with eight times its own mass of oxygen
gas to form water. He guessed that water consisted of
combinations of 1 atom of hydrogen with 1 atom of oxygen.
(A combination of atoms is called a &ldquo;molecule&rdquo; from a Greek
word meaning &ldquo;a small mass&rdquo;, and so hydrogen and oxygen
atoms can be said to combine to form a &ldquo;water molecule&rdquo;.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_5">

<p class="caption small"><i>John Dalton</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>To account for the difference in the masses of the
combining gases, Dalton decided that the oxygen atom was
eight times as massive as the hydrogen atom. If he set the
mass of the hydrogen atom at 1 (just for convenience) then
the mass of the oxygen atom ought to be set at 8. These
comparative, or relative, numbers were said to be &ldquo;atomic
weights&rdquo;, so that what Dalton was suggesting was that the
atomic weight of hydrogen was 1 and the atomic weight of
oxygen was 8. By noting the quantity of other elements that
combined with a fixed mass of oxygen or of hydrogen,
Dalton could work out the atomic weights of these elements
as well.</p>
<p>Dalton&rsquo;s idea was right, but his details were wrong in
some cases. For instance, on closer examination it turned out
that the water molecule was composed of 1 oxygen atom and
2 hydrogen atoms. For this reason, the water molecule may
be written H&#8322;O, where H is the chemical symbol for a
hydrogen atom, and O for an oxygen atom.</p>
<p>It is still a fact that a quantity of hydrogen combines
with eight times its mass of oxygen, so the single oxygen
atom must be eight times as massive as the 2 hydrogen atoms
taken together. The oxygen atom must therefore be sixteen
times as massive as a single hydrogen atom. If the atomic
weight of hydrogen is 1, then the atomic weight of oxygen is
16.</p>
<p>At first it seemed that the atomic weights of the various
elements were whole numbers and that hydrogen was the
lightest one. It made particular sense, then, to consider the
atomic weight of hydrogen as 1, because that made all the
other atomic weights as small as possible and therefore easy
to handle.</p>
<p>The Swedish chemist J&ouml;ns Jakob Berzelius (1779-1848)
continued Dalton&rsquo;s work and found that elements did not
combine in quite such simple ratios. A given quantity of
hydrogen actually combined with a little bit less than eight
times its mass of oxygen. Therefore if the atomic weight of
hydrogen were considered to be 1, the atomic weight of
oxygen would have to be not 16, but 15.87.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>

<p class="caption small"><i>J&ouml;ns Jakob Berzelius</i></p>
</div>
<p>As it happens, oxygen combines with more elements (and
more easily) than hydrogen does. The ratio of its atomic
weight to that of other elements is also more often a whole
number. In working out the atomic weight of elements it was
therefore more convenient to set the atomic weight of
oxygen at a whole number than that of hydrogen. Berzelius
did this, for instance, in the table of atomic weights he
published in 1828. At first he called the atomic weight of
oxygen 100. Then he decided to make the atomic weights as
small as possible, without allowing any atomic weight to be
less than 1. For that reason, he set the atomic weight of
oxygen at exactly 16 and in that case, the atomic weight of
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
hydrogen had to be placed just a trifle higher than 1. The
atomic weight of hydrogen became 1.008. This system was
retained for nearly a century and a half.</p>
<p>Throughout the 19th century, chemists kept on working
out atomic weights more and more carefully. By the start of
the 20th century, most elements had their atomic weights
worked out to two decimal places, sometimes three.</p>
<p>A number of elements had atomic weights that were
nearly whole numbers on the &ldquo;oxygen = 16&rdquo; standard. The
atomic weight of aluminum was just about 27, that of
calcium almost 40, that of carbon almost 12, that of gold
almost 197, and so on.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some elements had atomic weights
that were far removed from whole numbers. The atomic
weight of chlorine was close to 35.5, that of copper to 63.5,
that of iron to 55.8, that of silver to 107.9, and so on.</p>
<p>Throughout the 19th century, chemists did not know
why so many atomic weights were whole numbers, while
others weren&rsquo;t. They simply made their measurements and
recorded what they found. For an explanation, they had to
wait for a line of investigation into electricity to come to
fruition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c3">ELECTRICITY</h2>
<h3 id="c4">Units of Electricity</h3>
<p>Through the 18th century, scientists had been fascinated
by the properties of electricity. Electricity seemed, at the
time, to be a very fine fluid that could extend through
ordinary matter without taking up any room.</p>
<p>Electricity did more than radiate through matter, however.
It also produced important changes in matter. In the
first years of the 19th century, it was found that a current of
electricity could cause different atoms or different groups of
atoms to move in opposite directions through a liquid in
which they were dissolved.</p>
<p>The English scientist Michael Faraday (1791-1867) noted
in 1832 that a given quantity of electricity seemed to liberate
the same number of atoms of a variety of different elements.
In some cases, though, it liberated just half the expected
number of atoms; or even, in a few cases, just a third.</p>
<p>Scientists began to speculate that electricity, like matter,
might consist of tiny units. When electricity broke up a
molecule, perhaps a unit of electricity attached itself to each
atom. In that case, the same quantity of electricity, containing
the same number of units, would liberate the same
number of atoms.</p>
<p>In the case of some elements, each atom could attach 2
units of electricity to itself, or perhaps even 3. When that
happened a given quantity of electricity would liberate only
one-half, or only one-third, the usual number of atoms.
(Thus, 18 units of electricity would liberate 18 atoms if
distributed 1 to an atom; only 9 atoms if distributed 2 to an
atom; and only 6 atoms if distributed 3 to an atom.)</p>
<p>It was understood at the time that electricity existed in
two varieties, which were called positive and negative. It
appeared that if an atom attached a positive unit of
electricity to itself it would be pulled in one direction
through the solution by the voltage. If it attached a negative
unit of electricity to itself it would be pulled in the other
direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>

<p class="caption small"><i>Michael Faraday</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The units of electricity were a great deal more difficult to
study than the atomic units of matter, and throughout the
19th century they remained elusive. In 1891, though, the
Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney (1826-1911) suggested
that the supposed unit of electricity be given a name
at least. He called the unit an &ldquo;electron&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="c5">Cathode Rays</h3>
<p>An electric current flows through a closed circuit of some
conducting material, such as metal wires. It starts at one pole
of a battery, or of some other electricity generating device,
and ends at the other. The two poles are the positive pole or
&ldquo;anode&rdquo; and the negative pole or &ldquo;cathode&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If there is a break in the circuit, the current will usually
not flow at all. If, however, the break is not a large one, and
the current is under a high driving force (which is called the
&ldquo;voltage&rdquo;), then the current may leap across the break. If
two ends of a wire, making up part of a broken circuit, are
brought close to each other with nothing but air between, a
spark may leap across the narrowing gap before they actually
meet and, while it persists, the current will flow despite the
break.</p>
<p>The light of the spark, and the crackling sound it makes,
are the results of the electric current interacting with
molecules of air and heating them. Neither the light nor the
sound is the electricity itself. In order to detect the
electricity, the current ought to be forced across a gap
containing nothing, not even air.</p>
<p>In order to do that, wires would have to be sealed into a
glass tube from which all (or almost all) the air was
withdrawn. This was not easy to do and it was not until
1854 that Heinrich Geissler (1814-1879), a German glass-blower
and inventor, accomplished this feat. The wires sealed
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
into such a &ldquo;Geissler tube&rdquo; could be attached to the poles of
an electric generator, and if enough voltage was built up, the
current would leap across the vacuum.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_8">
<img src="images/pmg008.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="273" />
<p class="caption small"><i>A Geissler tube.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Such experiments were first performed by the German
physicist Julius Pl&uuml;cker (1801-1868). In 1858 he noticed that
when the current flowed across the vacuum there was a
greenish glow about the wire that was attached to the
cathode of the generator. Others studied this glow and finally
the German physicist Eugen Goldstein (1850-1931) decided
in 1876 that there were rays of some sort beginning at the
wire attached to the negatively charged cathode and ending
at the part of the tube opposite the cathode. He called them
&ldquo;cathode rays&rdquo;.</p>
<p>These cathode rays, it seemed, might well be the electric
current itself, freed from the metal wires that usually carried
it. If so, determining the nature of the cathode rays might
reveal a great deal about the nature of the electric current.
Were cathode rays something like light and were they made
up of tiny waves? Or were they a stream of particles
possessing mass?</p>
<p>There were physicists on each side of the question. By
1885, however, the English physicist William Crookes
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
(1832-1919) showed that cathode rays could be made to turn
a small wheel when they struck that wheel on one side. This
seemed to show that the cathode rays possessed mass and
were a stream of atom-like particles, rather than a beam of
mass-less light. Furthermore, Crookes showed that the
cathode rays could be pushed sideways in the presence of a
magnet. (This effect, when current flows in a wire, is what
makes a motor work.) This meant that, unlike either light or
ordinary atoms, the cathode rays carried an electric charge.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_9">
<img src="images/pmg009.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="419" />
<p class="caption small"><i>J. J. Thomson in his laboratory. On his right are early X-ray pictures.</i></p>
</div>
<p>This view of the cathode rays as consisting of a stream of
electrically charged particles was confirmed by another
English physicist, Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940). In
1897 he showed that the cathode rays could also be made to
take a curved path in the presence of electrically charged
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
objects. The particles making up the cathode rays were
charged with negative electricity, judging from the direction
in which they were made to curve by electrically charged
objects.</p>
<p>Thomson had no hesitation in maintaining that these
particles carried the units of electricity that Faraday&rsquo;s work
had hinted at. Eventually, Stoney&rsquo;s name for the units of
electricity was applied to the particles that carried those
units. The cathode rays, in other words, were considered to
be made up of streams of electrons and Thomson is usually
given credit for having discovered the electron.</p>
<p>The extent to which cathode rays curved in the presence
of a magnet or electrically charged objects depended on the
size of the electric charge on the electrons and on the mass of
the electrons. Ordinary atoms could be made to carry an
electric charge and by comparing their behavior with those of
electrons, some of the properties of electrons could be
determined.</p>
<p>There were, for instance, good reasons to suppose that
the electron carried a charge of the same size as one that a
hydrogen atom could be made to carry. The electrons,
however, were much easier to pull out of their straight-line
path than the charged hydrogen atom was. The conclusion
drawn from this was that the electron had much less mass
than the hydrogen atom.</p>
<p>Thomson was able to show, indeed, that the electron was
much lighter than the hydrogen atom, which was the lightest
of all the atoms. Nowadays we know the relationship quite
exactly. We know that it would take 1837.11 electrons to
possess the mass of a single hydrogen atom. The electron is
therefore a &ldquo;subatomic particle&rdquo;; the first of this sort to be
discovered.</p>
<p>In 1897, then, two types of mass-containing particles
were known. There were the atoms, which made up ordinary
matter, and the electrons, which made up electric current.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3 id="c6">Radioactivity</h3>
<p>Was there a connection between these two sets of
particles&mdash;atoms and electrons? In 1897, when the electron
was discovered, a line of research that was to tie the two kinds
of particles together had already begun.</p>
<p>In 1895 the German physicist Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen
(1845-1923) was working with cathode rays. He found that if
he made the cathode rays strike the glass at the other end of
the tube, a kind of radiation was produced. This radiation
was capable of penetrating glass and other matter. Roentgen
had no idea as to the nature of the radiation, and so called it
&ldquo;X rays&rdquo;. This name, containing &ldquo;X&rdquo; for &ldquo;unknown&rdquo;, was
retained even after physicists worked out the nature of X
rays and found them to be light-like radiation made up of
waves much shorter than those of ordinary light.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_10">
<img src="images/pmg010.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="680" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Antoine Henri Becquerel.</i></p>
</div>
<p>At once, physicists became fascinated with X rays and
began searching for them everywhere. One of those involved
in the search was the French physicist Antoine Henri
Becquerel (1852-1908). A certain compound, potassium
uranyl sulfate, glowed after being exposed to sunlight and
Becquerel wondered if this glow, like the glow on the glass in
Roentgen&rsquo;s X-ray tube, contained X rays.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>

<p class="caption small"><i>Wilhelm Roentgen and his laboratory at the University of W&uuml;rzburg.</i></p>
</div>
<p>It did, but while investigating the problem in 1896,
Becquerel found that the compound was giving off invisible
penetrating X-ray-like radiation continually, whether it was
exposed to sunlight or not. The radiation was detected
because it would fog a photographic plate just as light would.
What&rsquo;s more, the radiation would fog the plate, even if the
plate were wrapped in black paper, so that it could penetrate
matter just as X rays could.</p>
<p>Others, in addition to Becquerel, were soon investigating
the new phenomenon. In 1898 the Polish (later French)
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
physicist Marie Sklodowska Curie (1867-1934) showed that
it was the uranium atom that was the source of the radiation,
and that any compound containing the uranium atom would
give off these penetrating rays.</p>
<p>Until then, uranium had not been of much interest to
chemists. It was a comparatively rare metal that was first
discovered in 1789 by the German chemist Martin Heinrich
Klaproth (1743-1817). It had no particular uses and remained
an obscure element. As chemists learned to work out
the atomic weights of the various elements, they found,
however, that, of the elements then known, uranium had the
highest atomic weight of all&mdash;238.</p>
<p>Once uranium was discovered to be an endless source of
radiation, it gained interest that has risen ever since.
Madame Curie gave the name &ldquo;radioactivity&rdquo; to this phenomenon
of continuously giving off rays. Uranium was the first
element found to be radioactive.</p>
<p>It did not remain alone, however. It was soon shown that
thorium was also radioactive. Thorium, which had been
discovered in 1829 by Berzelius, was made up of atoms that
were the second most massive known at the time. Thorium&rsquo;s
atomic weight is 232.</p>
<p>But what was the mysterious radiation emitted by
uranium and thorium?</p>
<p>Almost at once it was learned that whatever the radiation
was, it was not uniform in properties. In 1899 Becquerel (and
others) showed that, in the presence of a magnet, some of the
radiation swerved in a particular direction. Later it was found
that a portion of it swerved in the opposite direction. Still
another part didn&rsquo;t swerve at all but moved on in a straight
line.</p>
<p>The conclusion was that uranium and thorium gave off
three kinds of radiation. One carried a positive charge of
electricity, one a negative charge, and one no charge at all.
The New Zealand-born physicist Ernest Rutherford
(1871-1937) called the first two kinds of radiation &ldquo;alpha
rays&rdquo; and &ldquo;beta rays&rdquo;, after the first two letters of the Greek
alphabet. The third was soon called &ldquo;gamma rays&rdquo; after the
third letter.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>The gamma rays eventually turned out to be another
light-like form of radiation, with waves even shorter than
those of X rays. The alpha rays and beta rays, which carried
electric charges, seemed to be streams of charged particles
(&ldquo;alpha particles&rdquo; and &ldquo;beta particles&rdquo;) just as the cathode
rays had turned out to be.</p>
<p>In 1900, indeed, Becquerel studied the beta particles and
found them to be identical in mass and charge with electrons.
They <i>were</i> electrons.</p>
<p>By 1906 Rutherford had worked out the nature of the
alpha particles. They carried a positive electric charge that
was twice as great as the electron&rsquo;s negative charge. If an
electron carried a charge that could be symbolized as -, then
the charge of the alpha particle was ++. Furthermore, the
alpha particle was much more massive than the electron. It
was, indeed, as massive as a helium atom (the second lightest
known atom) and four times as massive as a hydrogen atom.
Nevertheless, the alpha particle can penetrate matter in a way
in which atoms cannot, so that it seems much smaller in
diameter than atoms are. The alpha particle, despite its mass,
is another subatomic particle.</p>
<p>Here, then, is the meeting point of electrons and of
atoms&mdash;the particles of electricity and of matter.</p>
<p>Ever since Dalton had first advanced the atomic theory
over a century earlier, chemists had assumed that atoms were
the fundamental units of matter. They had assumed atoms
were as small as anything could be and that they could not
possibly be broken up into anything smaller. The discovery
of the electron, however, had shown that some particles, at
least, might be far smaller than any atom. Then, the
investigations into radioactivity had shown that atoms of
uranium and thorium spontaneously broke up into smaller
particles, including electrons and alpha particles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>It would seem, then, that atoms of these elements and,
presumably, of all elements, were made up of still smaller
particles and that among these particles were electrons. The
atom had a structure and physicists became interested in
discovering exactly what that structure was.</p>
<h3 id="c7">The Structure of the Atom</h3>
<p>Since radioactive atoms gave off either positively charged
particles or negatively charged particles, it seemed reasonable
to assume that atoms generally were made up of both types
of electricity. Furthermore, since the atoms in matter
generally carried no charge at all, the normal &ldquo;neutral atom&rdquo;
must be made up of equal quantities of positive charge and
negative charge.</p>
<p>It turned out that only radioactive atoms, such as those
of uranium and thorium, gave off positively charged alpha
particles. Many atoms, however, that were not radioactive,
could be made to give off electrons. In 1899 Thomson
showed that certain perfectly normal metals with no trace of
radioactivity gave off electrons when exposed to ultraviolet
light. (This is called the &ldquo;photoelectric effect&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>It was possible to suppose, then, that the main structure
of the atom was positively charged and generally immovable,
and that there were also present light electrons, which could
easily be detached. Thomson had suggested, as early as 1898,
that the atom was a ball of matter carrying a positive charge
and that individual electrons were stuck throughout its
substance, like raisins in pound cake.</p>
<p>If something like the Thomson view were correct then
the number of electrons, each with one unit of negative
electricity, would depend on the total size of the positive
charge carried by the atom. If the charge were +5, there
would have to be 5 electrons present to balance that. The
total charge would then be 0 and the atom as a whole would
be electrically neutral.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>If, in such a case, an electron were removed, the atomic
charge of +5 would be balanced by only 4 electrons with a
total charge of -4. In that case, the net charge of the atom as
a whole would be +1. On the other hand, if an extra electron
were forced onto the atom, the charge of +5 would be
balanced by 6 electrons with a total charge of -6, and the
net charge of the atom as a whole would be -1.</p>
<p>Such electrically charged atoms were called &ldquo;ions&rdquo; and
their existence had been suspected since Faraday&rsquo;s day.
Faraday had known that atoms had to travel through a
solution under the influence of an electric field to account
for the way in which metals and gases appeared at the
cathode and anode. It was he who first used the term, ion,
from a Greek word meaning &ldquo;traveller&rdquo;. The word had been
suggested to him by the English scholar, William Whewell
(1794-1866). In 1884 the Swedish chemist Svante August
Arrhenius (1859-1927) had first worked out a detailed
theory based on the suggestion that these ions were atoms or
groups of atoms that carried an electric charge.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_16">
<img src="images/pmg016.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="504" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Svante A. Arrhenius</i></p>
</div>
<p>By the close of the 19th century, then, Arrhenius&rsquo;s
suggestion seemed correct. There were positive ions made up
of atoms or groups of atoms, from which one or more of the
electrons within the atoms had been removed. There were
negative ions made up of single atoms or of groups of atoms,
to which one or more extra electrons had been added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_17">
<img src="images/pmg017.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="228" />
</div>
<p>Although Thomson&rsquo;s model of the atom explained the
existence of ions and the fact that atoms could give off
electrons or absorb them, it was not satisfactory in all ways.
Further investigations yielded results not compatible with the
raisins-in-the-pound-cake notion.</p>
<p>In 1906 Rutherford began to study what happened when
massive subatomic particles, such as alpha particles, passed
through matter. When alpha particles passed through a thin
film of gold, for instance, they raced through, for the most
part, as though nothing were there. The alpha particles
seemed to push the light electrons aside and to act as though
the positively charged main body of the atom that Thomson
had pictured was not solid, but was soft and spongy.</p>
<p>The only trouble was that every once in a while an alpha
particle seemed to strike something in the gold film and
bounce to one side. Sometimes it even bounced directly
backward. It was as though somewhere in each atom there
was something at least as massive as the alpha particle.</p>
<p>How large was this massive portion of the atom? It
couldn&rsquo;t be very large for if it were the alpha particles would
hit it frequently. Instead, the alpha particles made very few
hits. This meant the massive portion was very small and that
most alpha particles tore through the atom without coming
anywhere near it.</p>

<p>By 1911 Rutherford announced his results to the world.
He suggested that just about all the mass of the atom was
concentrated into a very tiny, positively charged &ldquo;nucleus&rdquo; at
its center. The diameter of the nucleus was only about
1/10,000 the diameter of the atom. All the rest of the atom
was filled with the very light electrons.</p>

<p>According to Rutherford&rsquo;s notion, the atom consisted of
a single tiny positively charged lead shot at the center of a
foam of electrons. It was Thomson&rsquo;s notion in reverse. Still,
the nucleus carried a positive charge of a particular size and
was balanced by negatively charged electrons. Rutherford&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
model of the atom explained the existence of ions just as
easily as Thomson&rsquo;s did and it explained more besides.</p>
<p>For instance, if all the electrons are removed so that only
the nucleus remains, this nucleus is as massive as an atom but
is so tiny in size that it can penetrate matter. The alpha
particle would be a bare atomic nucleus from this point of
view.</p>
<p>Rutherford&rsquo;s model of the &ldquo;nuclear atom&rdquo; is still
accepted today.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Atomic Numbers</h3>
<p>Since the atom consisted of a positively charged nucleus
at the center, and a number of negatively charged electrons
outside, the next step was to find the exact size of the
nuclear charge and the exact number of electrons for the
different varieties of atoms.</p>
<p>The answer came through a line of research that began
with the English physicist Charles Glover Barkla
(1877-1944). In 1911 he noted that when X rays passed
through atoms, some were absorbed and some bounced back.
Those that bounced back had a certain ability to penetrate
other matter. When the X rays struck atoms of high atomic
weight, the X rays that bounced back were particularly
penetrating. In fact, each different type of atom seemed
associated with reflected X rays of a particular penetrating
power, so Barkla called these &ldquo;characteristic X rays&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In 1913 another English physicist, Henry Gwyn-Jeffreys
Moseley (1887-1915), went into the matter more thoroughly.
He measured the exact wavelength of the characteristic X
rays by reflecting them from certain crystals. In crystals,
atoms are arranged in regular order and at known distances
from each other. X rays reflecting from (or more accurately,
diffracting from) crystals are bent out of their path by the
rows of atoms. The longer their waves, the more they are
bent. From the degree of bending the wavelength of the
waves can be determined.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Moseley found that the greater the atomic weight of an
atom, the shorter the waves of the characteristic X rays
associated with it and the more penetrating those X rays
were. There was such a close connection, in fact, that
Moseley could arrange the elements in order according to the
wavelength of the characteristic X rays.</p>
<p>For some 40 years prior to this, the elements had been
listed in order of atomic weight. This was useful especially
since the Russian chemist Dmitri I. Mendel&eacute;ev (1834-1907)
had arranged them in a &ldquo;periodic table&rdquo; based on the atomic
weight order in such a way that elements of similar properties
were grouped together. The elements in this table were
sometimes numbered consecutively (&ldquo;atomic number&rdquo;) but
this was inconvenient since, when new elements were
discovered, the list of atomic numbers might have to be
reorganized.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885-1962) had just
advanced a theory of atomic structure that made it reasonable
to suppose that the wavelength of the characteristic X
rays depended on the size of the nuclear charge of the atoms
making up a particular element. Moseley therefore suggested
that these X rays be used to determine the size of the positive
charge on its nucleus. The atomic number could then be set
equal to that charge and be made independent of new
discoveries of elements.</p>
<p>Hydrogen, for instance, has an atomic number of 1. Its
nucleus carries a unit positive charge, +1, and the hydrogen
atom possesses 1 electron to balance this. Helium, with an
atomic number of 2, has a nuclear charge of +2 and 2
electrons, with a total charge of -2, to balance it. (The alpha
particle released by radioactive atoms is identical with a
helium nucleus.)</p>
<p>The atomic number increases as one goes up the line of
atoms. Oxygen atoms, for instance, have an atomic number
of 8 and iron atoms have one of 26. At the upper end,
thorium is 90 and uranium is 92. Each uranium atom has a
nucleus bearing a charge of +92 and contains 92 electrons to
balance this.</p>
<p>Once the notion of the atomic number was worked out,
it became possible to tell for certain whether any elements
remained as yet undiscovered and, if so, where in the list they
might be.</p>
<p>Thus, when Moseley first presented scientists with the
atomic number it turned out that there were still 7 elements
that were not discovered. At least elements with atomic
numbers of 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, 87, and 91 were still not
known. By 1945, all seven had been discovered.</p>
<p>It quickly turned out that the atomic number was more
fundamental and more characteristic of a particular element
than was the atomic weight.</p>

<p>Since Dalton&rsquo;s time it had been assumed that all the
atoms of a particular element were of equal atomic weight
and that atoms of two different elements were always of
different atomic weight. The first inkling and the first proof
that this might not be so came through the study of
radioactivity.</p>

<h3 id="c9">Isotopes</h3>
<p>In 1902 Rutherford and his co-worker Frederick Soddy
(1877-1956) showed that when uranium atoms gave off alpha
particles, a new kind of atom was formed that was not
uranium at all. It was this new atom that was eventually
found to give off a beta particle, and then another atom of
still another element was formed. This work of Rutherford
and Soddy began a line of investigation that by 1907 had
shown that there was a whole radioactive chain of elements,
each one breaking down to the next in line by giving off
either an alpha particle or a beta particle, until finally a lead
atom was formed that was not radioactive.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>There was, in short, a &ldquo;radioactive series&rdquo; beginning with
uranium (atomic number 92) and ending with lead (atomic
number 82). The same was true of thorium (atomic number
90), which began a series that also ended with lead. Still a
third element, actinium (atomic number 89) was, at that
time, the first known member of a series that also ended in
lead.</p>
<p>The various atoms formed in these three radioactive series
were not all different in every way. When the uranium atom
gives off an alpha particle, it forms an atom originally called
&ldquo;uranium X&#8321;&rdquo;. On close investigation, it turned out that this
uranium X&#8321; had the chemical properties of thorium. Uranium
X&#8321;, had, however, radioactive properties different from
ordinary thorium.</p>
<p>Uranium X&#8321; broke down so rapidly, giving off beta
particles as it did so, that half of any given quantity would
have broken down in 24 days. Another way of saying this
(which was introduced by Rutherford) was that the &ldquo;half-life&rdquo;
of uranium X&#8321;, is 24 days. Ordinary thorium, however,
gives off alpha particles, not beta particles, and does so at
such a slow rate, that its half-life is 14 billion years!</p>
<p>Uranium X&#8321;, and ordinary thorium were in the same place
in the list of elements by chemical standards, and yet there
was clearly something different about the two.</p>
<p>Here is another case. In 1913 the British chemist
Alexander Fleck (1889-<span class="hst"> )</span> studied &ldquo;radium B&rdquo; and
&ldquo;radium D&rdquo;, the names given to two different kinds of atoms
in the uranium radioactive series. He also studied &ldquo;thorium
B&rdquo; in the thorium radioactive series and &ldquo;actinium B&rdquo; in the
actinium radioactive series. All four are chemically the same
as ordinary lead; all four are in the same place in the list of
elements. Yet each is different from the radioactive standpoint.
Though all give off beta particles, radium B has a
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
half-life of 27 minutes, radium D one of 19 years, thorium B
one of 11 hours, and actinium B one of 36 minutes.</p>
<p>In 1913 Soddy called atoms that were in the same place
in the list of elements, but which had different radioactive
properties, &ldquo;isotopes&rdquo;, from Greek words meaning &ldquo;same
place&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At first, it seemed that the only difference between
isotopes might be in their radioactive properties and that
only radioactive atoms were involved. Quickly that proved
not to be so.</p>
<p>It proved that it was possible to have several forms of the
same element that were all different even though none of
them were radioactive. The uranium series, the thorium
series, and the actinium series all ended in lead. In each case
the lead formed was stable (not radioactive). Were the lead
atoms identical in every case? Soddy had worked out the way
in which atomic weights altered every time an alpha particle
or a beta particle was given off by an atom. Working through
the three radioactive series he decided that the lead atoms
had different atomic weights in each case.</p>
<p>The uranium series ought to end with lead atoms that had
an atomic weight of 206. The thorium series ought to end in
lead atoms with an atomic weight of 208 and the actinium
series in lead atoms with an atomic weight of 207.</p>
<p>If this were so, there would be 3 lead isotopes that would
differ not in radioactive properties, but in atomic weight. The
isotopes could be referred to as lead-206, lead-207, and
lead-208. If we use the chemical symbol for lead (Pb), we
could write the isotopes, &sup2;&#8304;&#8310;Pb, &sup2;&#8304;&#8311;Pb, and &sup2;&#8304;&#8312;Pb. (We read
the symbol &sup2;&#8304;&#8310;Pb as lead-206.) Atomic weight measurements
made in 1914 by Soddy and others supported that theory.</p>
<p>All 3 lead isotopes had the same atomic number of 82.
The atoms of all 3 isotopes had nuclei with an electric charge
of +82 and all 3 had 82 electrons in the atom to balance that
positive nuclear charge. The difference was in the mass of the
nucleus only.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>But what of ordinary lead that existed in the rocks far
removed from any radioactive substances and that had
presumably been stable through all the history of earth? Its
atomic weight was 207.2.</p>
<p>Was the stable lead that had no connection with
radioactivity made up of atoms of still another isotope, one
with a fractional atomic weight? Or could stable lead be
made up of a mixture of isotopes, each of a different
whole-number atomic weight and was the overall atomic
weight a fraction only because it was an average?</p>
<p>It was at the moment difficult to tell in the case of lead,
but an answer came in connection with another element, the
rare gas neon (atomic symbol Ne), which has an atomic
weight of 20.2.</p>
<p>Was that fractional atomic weight something that was
possessed by all neon atoms without exception or was it the
average of some lightweight atoms and some heavyweight
ones? It would be a matter of crucial importance if isotopes
of neon could be found, for neon had nothing to do with
any of the radioactive series. If neon had isotopes then any
element might have them.</p>
<p>In 1912 Thomson was working on neon. He sent a stream
of cathode-ray electrons through neon gas. The electrons
smashed into the neon atoms and knocked an electron off
some of them. That left a neon ion carrying a single positive
charge&mdash;an ion that could be written Ne&#8314;.</p>
<p>The neon ions move in the electric field as electrons do,
but in the opposite direction since they have an opposite
charge. In the combined presence of a magnet and of an
electric field, the neon ions move in a curved path. If all the
neon ions had the same mass, all would follow the same
curve. If some were more massive than others, the more
massive ones would curve less.</p>
<p>The neon ions ended on a photographic plate, which was
darkened at the point of landing. There were two regions of
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
darkening, because there were neon ions of two different
masses that curved in two different degrees and ended in two
different places. Thomson showed, from the amount of
curving, that there was a neon isotope with an atomic weight
of 20 and one with an atomic weight of 22&mdash;&sup2;&#8304;Ne and
&sup2;&sup2;Ne.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, from the intensity of darkening, it could be
seen that ordinary neon was made up of atoms that were
roughly 90% &sup2;&#8304;Ne and 10% &sup2;&sup2;Ne. The overall atomic weight
of neon, 20.2, was the average atomic weight of these 2
isotopes.</p>
<p>Thomson&rsquo;s instrument was the first one capable of
separating isotopes and such instruments came to be called
&ldquo;mass spectrometers&rdquo;. The first to use the name was the
English physicist Francis William Aston (1877-1945), who
built the first efficient instrument of this type in 1919.</p>
<p>He used it to study as many elements as he could. He and
those who followed him located many isotopes and determined
the frequency of their occurrence with considerable
precision. It turned out, for instance, that neon is actually
90.9% &sup2;&#8304;Ne, and 8.8% &sup2;&sup2;Ne. Very small quantities of still a
third isotope, &sup2;&sup1;Ne, are also present, making up 0.3%.</p>
<p>As for ordinary lead in nonradioactive rocks, it is made
up of 23.6% &sup2;&#8304;&#8310;Pb, 22.6% &sup2;&#8304;&#8311;Pb, and 52.3% &sup2;&#8304;&#8312;Pb. There
is still a fourth isotope, &sup2;&#8304;&#8308;Pb, which makes up the
remaining 1.5% and which is not the product of any
radioactive series at all.</p>
<p>The isotopes always have atomic weights that are close
to, but not quite, whole numbers. Any atomic weight of an
element that departs appreciably from an integer does so
only because it is an average of different isotopes. For
instance, the atomic weight of chlorine (chemical symbol Cl)
is 35.5, but this is because it is made up of a mixture of 2
isotopes. About one quarter of chlorine&rsquo;s atoms are &sup3;&#8311;Cl and
about three-quarters are &sup3;&#8309;Cl.</p>

</div>
<p>To avoid confusion, the average mass of the isotopes that
make up a particular element is still called the atomic weight
of that element. The integer closest to the mass of the
individual isotope is spoken of as the &ldquo;mass number&rdquo; of that
isotope. Thus, chlorine is made up of isotopes with mass
numbers 35 and 37, but the atomic weight of chlorine as it is
found in nature is 35.5 (or, to be more accurate, 35.453).</p>
<p>In the same way, ordinary lead is made up of isotopes
with mass numbers 204, 206, 207, and 208, and its atomic
weight is 207.19; neon is made up of isotopes with mass
numbers 20, 21, and 22, and its atomic weight is 20.183, and
so on.</p>
<p>If the atomic weight of some element happens to be very
close to a whole number to begin with, it may consist of a
single kind of atom. For instance, the gas fluorine (chemical
symbol F) has an atomic weight of nearly 19, while that of
the metal sodium (chemical symbol Na) is nearly 23. As it
turns out, all the atoms of fluorine are of the single variety
&sup1;&#8313;F, while all the atoms of sodium are &sup2;&sup3;Na.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Sometimes the atomic weight of an element, as it occurs
in nature, is nearly a whole number and yet it is made up of
more than 1 isotope. In that case, one of the isotopes makes
up very nearly all of it, while the others are present in such
minor quantities that the average is hardly affected.</p>
<p>Helium, for instance (atomic symbol He) has an atomic
weight of just about 4 and, indeed, almost all the atoms
making it up are &#8308;He. However, 0.0001% of the atoms, or
one out of a million, are &sup3;He. Again, 99.6% of all the
nitrogen atoms (atomic symbol N) are &sup1;&#8308;N, but 0.4% are
&sup1;&#8309;N. Then, 98.9% of all carbon atoms (atomic symbol C) are
&sup1;&sup2;C, but 1.1% are &sup1;&sup3;C. It is not surprising that the atomic
weights of nitrogen and carbon are just about 14 and 12,
respectively.</p>

<p>Even hydrogen does not escape. Its atomic weight is just
about 1 and most of its atoms are &sup1;H. The American chemist
Harold Clayton Urey (1893-<span class="hst"> )</span> detected the existence of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
more massive isotope, &sup2;H. This isotope has almost twice the
mass of the lighter one. No other isotopes of a particular
atom differ in mass by so large a factor. For that reason &sup2;H
and &sup1;H differ in ordinary chemical properties more than
isotopes usually do and Urey therefore gave &sup2;H the special
name of &ldquo;deuterium&rdquo; from a Greek word meaning &ldquo;second&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="caption small"><i>W. F. Giauque</i></p>
</div>
<p>In 1929 the American chemist William Francis Giauque
(1895-<span class="hst"> )</span> found that oxygen was composed of more than
1 isotope. Its atomic weight had been set arbitrarily at
16.0000 so it was a relief that 99.76% of its atoms were &sup1;&#8310;O.
However, 0.20% were &sup1;&#8312;O, and 0.04% were &sup1;&#8311;O.</p>
<p>As you see, &sup1;&#8310;O must have a mass number of slightly less
than 16.0000 and it must be the more massive isotopes &sup1;&#8311;O
and &sup1;&#8312;O that pull the average up to 16.0000. Disregarding
this, chemists clung to a standard atomic weight of 16.000
for oxygen as it appeared in nature, preferring not to concern
themselves with the separate isotopes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Physicists, however, felt uneasy at using an average as
standard for they were more interested in working with
individual isotopes. They preferred to set &sup1;&#8310;O at 16.0000 so
that the average atomic weight of oxygen was 16.0044 and
all other atomic weights rose in proportion. Atomic weights
determined by this system were &ldquo;physical atomic weights&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Finally, in 1961, a compromise was struck. Chemists and
physicists alike decided to consider the atomic weight of &sup1;&sup2;C
as exactly 12 and to use that as a standard. By this system,
the atomic weight of oxygen became 15.9994, which is only
very slightly less than 16.</p>
<p>The radioactive elements did not escape this new view
either. The atomic weight of uranium (chemical symbol U) is
just about 238 and, indeed, most of its atoms are &sup2;&sup3;&#8312;U. In
1935, however, the Canadian-American physicist, Arthur
Jeffrey Dempster (1886-1950), found that 0.7% of its atoms
were a lighter isotope, &sup2;&sup3;&#8309;U.</p>
<p>These differed considerably in radioactive properties. The
common uranium isotope, &sup2;&sup3;&#8312;U, had a half-life of 4500
million years, while &sup2;&sup3;&#8309;U had a half-life of only 700 million
years. Furthermore &sup2;&sup3;&#8309;U broke down in three stages to
actinium. It was &sup2;&sup3;&#8309;U, not actinium itself, that was the
beginning of the actinium radioactive series.</p>
<p>As for thorium (atomic symbol Th) with an atomic
weight of 232, it did indeed turn out that in the naturally
occurring element virtually all the atoms were &sup2;&sup3;&sup2;Th.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h2 id="c10">ENERGY</h2>
<h3 id="c11">The Law of Conservation of Energy</h3>
<p>We have now gone as far as we conveniently can in
considering the intertwining strands of the atom and of
electricity. It is time to turn to the third strand&mdash;energy.</p>
<p>To physicists the concept of &ldquo;work&rdquo; is that of exerting a
force on a body and making it move through some distance.
To lift a weight against the pull of gravity is work. To drive a
nail into wood against the friction of its fibers is work.</p>
<p>Anything capable of performing work is said to possess
&ldquo;energy&rdquo; from Greek words meaning &ldquo;work within&rdquo;. There
are various forms of energy. Any moving mass possesses
energy by virtue of its motion. That is, a moving hammer will
drive a nail into wood, while the same hammer held
motionlessly against the nailhead will not do so. Heat is a
form of energy, since it will expand steam that will force
wheels into motion that can then do work. Electricity,
magnetism, sound, and light can be made to perform work
and are forms of energy.</p>
<p>The forms of energy are so many and so various that
scientists were eager to find some rule that covered them all
and would therefore serve as a unifying bond. It did not seem
impossible that such a rule might exist, since one had been
found in connection with matter that appeared in even
greater variety than energy did.</p>
<p>All matter, whatever its form and shape, possessed mass,
and in the 1770s, the French chemist Antoine Laurent
Lavoisier (1743-1794) discovered that the quantity of mass
was constant. If a system of matter were isolated and made
to undergo complicated chemical reactions, everything about
it might change, but not its mass. A solid might turn into a
gas; a single substance might change into two or three
different substances, but whatever happened, the total mass
at the end was exactly the same (as nearly as chemists could
tell) as at the beginning. None was either created or
destroyed, however, the nature of the matter might change.
This was called the &ldquo;law of conservation of mass&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Naturally, it would occur to scientists to wonder if a
similar law might hold for energy. The answer wasn&rsquo;t easy to
get. It wasn&rsquo;t as simple to measure the quantity of energy as
it was to measure the quantity of mass. Nor was it as simple
to pen up a quantity of energy and keep it from escaping or
from gaining additional quantity from outside, as it was in
the case of mass.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1840, however, the English physicist James
Prescott Joule (1818-1889) began a series of experiments in
which he made use of every form of energy he could think
of. In each case he turned it into heat and allowed the heat to
raise the temperature of a given quantity of water. He used
the rise in temperature as a measure of the energy. By 1847
he was convinced that any form of energy could be turned
into fixed and predictable amounts of heat; that a certain
amount of work was equivalent to a certain amount of heat.</p>
<p>In that same year, the German physicist Hermann Ludwig
Ferdinand von Helmholtz (1821-1894) advanced the general
notion that a fixed amount of energy in one form was equal
to the same amount of energy in any other form. Energy
might change its form over and over, but not change its
amount. None could either be destroyed or created. This is
the &ldquo;law of conservation of energy&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Chemical Energy</h3>
<p>There is energy in a piece of wood. Left quietly to itself,
it seems completely incapable of bringing about any kind of
work. Set it on fire, however, and the wood plus the oxygen
in the air will give off heat and light that are clearly forms of
energy. The heat could help boil water and run a steam
engine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The amount of energy in burning wood could be
measured if it were mixed with air and allowed to burn in a
closed container that was immersed in a known quantity of
water. From the rise in temperature of the water, the
quantity of energy produced could be measured in units
called &ldquo;calories&rdquo; (from a Latin word for &ldquo;heat&rdquo;). The
instrument was therefore called a &ldquo;calorimeter&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the 1860s the French chemist Pierre Eug&egrave;ne Marcelin
Berthelot (1827-1907) carried through hundreds of such
determinations. His work and similar work by others made it
clear that such &ldquo;chemical energy&rdquo;&mdash;the energy derived from
chemical changes in matter&mdash;fit the law of conservation of
energy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it looked in the last decades of the 19th
century.</p>
<p>Molecules are composed of combinations of atoms.
Within the molecules, the atoms stick together more or less
tightly. It takes a certain amount of energy to pull a molecule
apart into separate atoms against the resistance of the forces
holding them together.</p>
<p>If, after being pulled apart, the atoms are allowed to
come together again, they give off energy. The amount of
energy they give off in coming together is exactly equal to
the amount of energy they had to gain before they could
separate.</p>
<p>This is true of all substances. For instance, hydrogen gas,
as it is found on earth, is made up of molecules containing 2
hydrogen atoms each (H&#8322;). Add a certain amount of energy
and you pull the atoms apart; allow the atoms to come back
together into paired molecules, and the added energy is given
back again. The same is true for the oxygen molecule, which
is made up of 2 oxygen atoms (O&#8322;) and of the water
molecule (H&#8322;O). Always the amount of energy absorbed in
one change is given off in the opposite change. The amount
absorbed and the amount given off are always exactly equal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>However, the amount of energy involved differs from
molecule to molecule. It is quite hard to pull hydrogen
molecules apart, and it is even harder to pull oxygen
molecules apart. You have to supply about 12% more energy
to pull an oxygen molecule apart than to pull a hydrogen
molecule apart. Naturally, if you let 2 oxygen atoms come
together to form an oxygen molecule, you get back 12%
more energy than if you allow 2 hydrogen atoms to come
together to form a hydrogen molecule.</p>
<p>It takes a considerably larger amount of energy to pull
apart a water molecule into separate atoms than to pull apart
either hydrogen or oxygen molecules. Naturally, that greater
energy is also returned once the hydrogen and oxygen atoms
are allowed to come back together into water molecules.</p>
<p>Next, imagine pulling apart hydrogen and oxygen molecules
into hydrogen and oxygen atoms and then having those
atoms come together to form <i>water</i> molecules. A certain
amount of energy is put into the system to break up the
hydrogen and oxygen molecules, but then a much greater
amount of energy is given off when the water molecules
form.</p>
<p>It is for that reason that a great deal of energy (mostly in
the form of heat) is given off if a jet of hydrogen gas and a jet
of oxygen gas are allowed to mix in such a way as to form
water.</p>
<p>Just mixing the hydrogen and oxygen isn&rsquo;t enough. The
molecules of hydrogen and oxygen must be separated and
that takes a little energy. The energy in a match flame is
enough to raise the temperature of the mixture and to make
the hydrogen and oxygen molecules move about more
rapidly and more energetically. This increases the chance that
some molecules will be broken up into separate atoms
(though the actual process is rather complicated). An oxygen
atom might then strike a hydrogen molecule to form water
(O + H&#8322; &rarr; H&#8322;O) and more energy is given off than was
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
absorbed from the match flame. The temperature goes up
still higher so that further breakup among the oxygen and
hydrogen molecules is encouraged.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_35">
<img src="images/pmg035.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="515" />
<p class="caption small"><i>The formation of a sodium chloride molecule.</i></p>
</div>
<p>This happens over and over again so that in very little
time, the temperature is very high and the hydrogen and
oxygen are combining to form water at an enormous rate. If
a great deal of hydrogen and oxygen are well-mixed to begin
with, the rate of reaction is so great that an explosion occurs.</p>
<p>Such a situation, in which each reacting bit of the system
adds energy to the system by its reaction and brings about
more reactions like itself, is called a &ldquo;chain reaction&rdquo;. Thus, a
match flame put to one corner of a large sheet of paper will
set that corner burning. The heat of the burning will ignite a
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
neighboring portion of the sheet and so on till the entire
sheet is burned. For that matter a single smoldering cigarette
end can serve to burn down an entire forest in a vastly
destructive chain reaction.</p>
<h3 id="c13">Electrons and Energy</h3>
<p>The discovery of the structure of the atom sharpened the
understanding of chemical energy.</p>
<p>In 1904 the German chemist Richard Abegg (1869-1910)
first suggested that atoms were held together through the
transfer of electrons from one atom to another.</p>
<p>To see how this worked, one began by noting that
electrons in an atom existed in a series of shells. The
innermost shell could hold only 2 electrons, the next 8, the
next 18 and so on. It turned out that some electron
arrangements were more stable than others. If only the
innermost shell contained electrons and it were filled with
the 2 electrons that were all it could hold, then that was a
stable arrangement. If an atom contained electrons in more
than one shell and the outermost shell that held electrons
held 8, that was a stable arrangement, too.</p>
<p>Thus, the helium atom has 2 electrons only, filling the
innermost shell, and that is so stable an arrangement that
helium undergoes no chemical reactions at all. The neon
atom has 10 electrons&mdash;2 in the innermost shell, and 8 in the
next&mdash;and it does not react. The argon atom has 18
electrons&mdash;2, 8, and 8&mdash;and it too is very stable.</p>
<p>But what if an atom did not have its electron shell so
neatly filled. The sodium atom has 11 electrons&mdash;2, 8, and
1&mdash;while the fluorine atom has 9 electrons&mdash;2 and 7. If the
sodium atom passed one of its electrons to a fluorine atom,
both would have the stable configuration of neon&mdash;2 and 8.
This, therefore, ought to have a great tendency to happen.</p>
<p>If it did happen, though, the sodium atom, minus 1
electron, would have a unit positive charge and would be Na&#8314;,
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
a positively charged ion. Fluorine with 1 electron in excess
would become F&#8315;, a negatively charged ion. The 2 ions, with
opposite charges, would cling together, since opposite charges
attract, and thus the molecule of sodium fluoride (NaF)
would be formed.</p>
<p>In 1916 the American chemist Gilbert Newton Lewis
(1875-1946) carried this notion farther. Atoms could cling
together not only as a result of the outright transfer of 1 or
more electrons, but through sharing pairs of electrons. This
sharing could only take place if the atoms remained close
neighbors, and it would take energy to pull them apart and
break up the shared pool, just as it would take energy to pull
2 ions apart against the attraction of opposite charges.</p>
<p>In this way the vague notions of atoms clinging together
in molecules and being forced apart gave way to a much more
precise picture of electrons being transferred or shared. The
electron shifts could be dealt with mathematically by a
system that came to be called &ldquo;quantum mechanics&rdquo; and
chemistry was thus made a more exact science than it had
ever been before.</p>
<h3 id="c14">The Energy of the Sun</h3>
<p>The most serious problem raised by the law of conservation
of energy involved the sun. Until 1847, scientists did not
question sunlight. The sun radiated vast quantities of energy
but that apparently was its nature and was no more to be
puzzled over than the fact that the earth rotated on its axis.</p>
<p>Once Helmholtz had stated that energy could neither be
created nor destroyed, however, he was bound to ask where
the sun&rsquo;s energy came from. It had, to man&rsquo;s best knowledge,
been radiating heat and light, with no perceptible change,
throughout the history of civilization and, from what
biologists and geologists could deduce, for countless ages
earlier. Where, then, did that energy come from?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>The sun gave the appearance of being a huge globe of fire.
Could it actually be that&mdash;a large heap of burning fuel,
turning chemical energy into heat and light?</p>
<p>The sun&rsquo;s mass was known and its rate of energy
production was known. Suppose the sun&rsquo;s mass were a
mixture of hydrogen and oxygen and it were burning at a
rate sufficient to produce the energy at the rate it was giving
it off. If that were so, all the hydrogen and oxygen in its mass
would be consumed in 1500 years. No chemical reaction in
the sun could account for its having given us heat and light
since the days of the pyramids, let alone since the days of the
dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Was there some source of energy greater than chemical
energy? What about the energy of motion? Helmholtz
suggested that meteors might be falling into the sun at a
steady rate. The energy of their collisions might then be
converted into heat and light and this could keep the sun
shining for as long as the supply of meteors held out&mdash;even
millions of years.</p>
<p>This, however, would mean that the sun&rsquo;s mass would be
increasing steadily, and so would the force of its gravitational
pull. With the sun&rsquo;s gravitational field increasing steadily, the
length of earth&rsquo;s year would be decreasing at a measurable
rate&mdash;but it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In 1854 Helmholtz came up with something better. He
suggested that the sun was contracting. Its outermost layers
were falling inward, and the energy of this fall was converted
into heat and light. What&rsquo;s more, this energy would be
obtained without any change in the mass of the sun
whatever.</p>
<p>Helmholtz calculated that the sun&rsquo;s contraction over the
6000 years of recorded history would have reduced its
diameter only 560 miles&mdash;a change that would not have
been noticeable to the unaided eye. Since the development of
the telescope, two and a half centuries earlier, the decrease in
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
diameter would have been only 23 miles and that was not
measurable by the best techniques of Helmholtz&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>Working backward, however, it seemed that 25 million
years ago, the sun must have been so large as to fill the
earth&rsquo;s orbit. Clearly the earth could not then have existed.
In that case, the maximum age of the earth was only 25
million years.</p>
<p>Geologists and biologists found themselves disturbed by
this. The slow changes in the earth&rsquo;s crust and in the
evolution of life made it seem very likely that the earth must
have been in existence&mdash;with the sun delivering heat and
light very much in the present fashion&mdash;for many hundreds
of millions of years.</p>
<p>Yet there seemed absolutely no other way of accounting
for the sun&rsquo;s energy supply. Either the law of conservation of
energy was wrong (which seemed unlikely), or the painfully
collected evidence of geologists and biologists was wrong
(which seemed unlikely),&mdash;or there was some source of
energy greater than any known in the 19th century, whose
existence had somehow escaped mankind (which also seemed
unlikely).</p>
<p>Yet one of those unlikely alternatives would have to be
true. And then in 1896 came the discovery of radioactivity.</p>
<h3 id="c15">The Energy of Radioactivity</h3>
<p>It eventually became clear that radioactivity involved the
giving off of energy. Uranium emitted gamma rays that we
now know to be a hundred thousand times as energetic as
ordinary light rays. What&rsquo;s more, alpha particles were being
emitted at velocities of perhaps 30,000 kilometers per
second, while the lighter beta particles were being shot off at
velocities of up to 250,000 kilometers per second (about 0.8
times the velocity of light).</p>
<p>At first, the total energy given off by radioactive
substances seemed so small that there was no use worrying
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
about it. The amount of energy liberated by a gram of
uranium in 1 second of radioactivity was an insignificant
fraction of the energy released by a burning candle.</p>
<p>In a few years, however, something became apparent. A
lump of uranium might give off very little energy in a second,
but it kept on for second after second, day after day, month
after month, and year after year with no perceptible
decrease. The energy released by the uranium over a very
long time grew to be enormous. It eventually turned out that
while the rate at which uranium delivered energy did decline,
it did so with such unbelievable slowness that it took 4.5
billion years (!) for that rate to decrease to half what it was
to begin with.</p>
<p>If <i>all</i> the energy delivered by a gram of uranium in the
course of its radioactivity over many billions of years was
totalled, it was enormously greater than the energy produced
by the burning of a candle with a mass equal to that of uranium.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it another way. We might think of a single
uranium atom breaking down and shooting off an alpha
particle. We might also think of a single carbon atom
combining with 2 oxygen atoms to form carbon dioxide. The
uranium atom would give off 2,000,000 times as much
energy in breaking down, as the carbon atom would in
combining.</p>
<p>The energy of radioactivity is millions of times as intense
as the energy released by chemical reactions. The reason
mankind had remained unaware of radioactivity and very
aware of chemical reactions was, first, that the most common
radioactive processes are so slow that their great energies
were stretched over such enormous blocks of time as to be
insignificant on a per second basis.</p>
<p>Secondly, chemical reactions are easily controlled by
changing quantities, concentrations, temperatures, pressures,
states of mixtures, and so on, and this makes them easy to
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
take note of and to study. The rate of radioactive changes,
however, could not apparently be altered. The early investigators
quickly found that the breakdown of uranium-238, for
instance, could not be hastened by heat, pressure, changes in
chemical combination, or, indeed, anything else they could
think of. It remained incredibly slow.</p>
<p>But despite all this, radioactivity had at last been
discovered and the intensity of its energies was recognized
and pointed out in 1902 by Marie Curie and her husband
Pierre Curie (1859-1906).</p>
<p>Where, then, did the energy come from? Could it come
from the outside? Could the radioactive atoms somehow
collect energy from their surroundings, concentrate it several
million-fold, and then let it out all at once?</p>
<p>To concentrate energy in this fashion would violate
something called &ldquo;the second law of thermodynamics&rdquo;. This
was first proposed in 1850 by the German physicist Rudolf
Julius Emmanuel Clausius (1822-1888) and had proved so
useful that physicists did not like to abandon it unless they
absolutely had to.</p>
<p>Another possibility was that radioactive atoms were
creating energy out of nothing. This, of course, violated the
law of conservation of energy (also called &ldquo;the first law of
thermodynamics&rdquo;) and physicists preferred not to do that
either.</p>
<p>The only thing that seemed to remain was to suppose
that somewhere within the atom was a source of energy that
had never made itself evident to humanity until the discovery
of radioactivity. Becquerel was one of the first to suggest
this.</p>
<p>It might have seemed at first that only radioactive
elements had this supply of energy somewhere within the
atom, but in 1903 Rutherford suggested that all atoms had a
vast energy supply hidden within themselves. The supply in
uranium and thorium leaked slightly, so to speak, and that
was all that made them different.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_36">
<img src="images/pmg036.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="434" />
<p class="caption small"><i>The room in which the Curies discovered radium. Pierre Curie&rsquo;s writing is on the blackboard.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>But if a vast supply of energy existed in atoms, it was
possible that the solution to the puzzle of the sun&rsquo;s energy
might rest there. As early as 1899 the American geologist
Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin (1843-1928) was already
speculating about a possible connection between radioactivity
and the sun&rsquo;s energy.</p>
<p>If it were some variety of this newly discovered source of
energy (not necessarily ordinary radioactivity, of course) that
powered the sun&mdash;millions of times as intense as chemical
energy&mdash;then the sun might be pouring out energy for
hundreds of millions of years without perceptible physical
change&mdash;just as uranium would show scarcely any change
even in so mighty a time span. The sun would not have to be
contracting; it would not have had to fill the earth&rsquo;s orbit
25,000,000 years ago.</p>
<p>This was all exciting, but in 1900 the structure of the
atom had not yet been worked out and this new energy was
just a vague supposition. No one had any idea of what it
actually might be or where in the atom it might be located. It
could only be spoken of as existing &ldquo;within the atom&rdquo; and
was therefore called &ldquo;atomic energy&rdquo;. Through long habit, it
is still called that much of the time. And yet &ldquo;atomic energy&rdquo;
is not a good name. In the first couple of decades of the 20th
century, it became apparent that ordinary chemical energy
involved electron shifts and those electrons were certainly
components of atoms. This meant that a wood fire was a
kind of atomic energy.</p>
<p>The electrons, however, existed only in the outer regions
of the atom. Once Rutherford worked out the theory of the
nuclear atom, it became apparent that the energy involved in
radioactivity and in solar radiation had to involve components
of the atom that were more massive and more
energetic than the light electrons. The energy had to come,
somehow, from the atomic nucleus.</p>
<p>What is involved then in radioactivity and in the sun is
&ldquo;nuclear energy&rdquo;. That is the proper name for it and in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
next section we will consider the subsequent history of the
nuclear energy that broke upon the startled consciousness of
scientists as the 20th century opened and which, less than
half a century later, was to face mankind with untold
consequences for good and for evil.</p>
